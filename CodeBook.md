## Identifiers

**subject** The ID of the test subject. 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Numeric.

**activity** The type of activiy performed when the corresponding measurement were taken. Six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) performed by the volunteers wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Character.
